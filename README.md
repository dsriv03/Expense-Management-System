# Expense-Management-System

This is an archive of my Expense Management System written in Python utilizing the pandas and matplotlib libraries. The project was made mostly to demonstrate how well I could create a standalone program in python in 2 weeks. As such, it lacks polish and relies heavily on try/catch blocks to handle initialization. 
I plan to rewrite the program in Java with a GUI in JavaFX sometime in the future, probably when the college stops giving me so many useless assignments.
